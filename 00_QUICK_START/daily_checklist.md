# 📅 Daily Solo Developer Checklist
*Keep momentum and avoid overwhelm*

## Morning Setup (15 min)
- [ ] **Review yesterday's progress**: What got done?
- [ ] **Check project tracker**: Update status in `04_MY_PROJECTS/project_tracker.md`
- [ ] **Plan today's focus**: Pick ONE major task
- [ ] **Set AI context**: Load project-specific prompts
- [ ] **Environment check**: All tools working? Dependencies updated?

## Development Sessions (Work in 90-min blocks)

### Session 1: Core Development
- [ ] **Time goal**: 90 minutes focused coding
- [ ] **AI prep**: Have prompts ready before coding
- [ ] **Single feature focus**: Don't context-switch
- [ ] **Regular commits**: Every working state
- [ ] **Test as you go**: Don't accumulate bugs

### Session 2: Polish & Test
- [ ] **Review morning's work**: Does it work end-to-end?
- [ ] **User perspective**: Use your app like a user would
- [ ] **AI code review**: Paste code, ask for improvements
- [ ] **Documentation update**: Keep README current
- [ ] **Deployment check**: Can you deploy right now?

## End of Day (15 min)
- [ ] **Progress update**: Update project tracker
- [ ] **Tomorrow's prep**: Write down first task for tomorrow
- [ ] **Backup work**: Push to git repository
- [ ] **Energy check**: Feeling good about progress?
- [ ] **Blocker identification**: What might slow you down tomorrow?

## Weekly Reviews (Friday, 30 min)
- [ ] **Week's accomplishments**: What shipped?
- [ ] **Timeline assessment**: On track for deadline?
- [ ] **Process improvements**: What worked well? What didn't?
- [ ] **Next week's priorities**: What's most important?
- [ ] **Workflow updates**: Any templates need tweaking?

## Emergency Protocols

### When Stuck (> 30 min on same problem)
1. **AI assistance**: Paste error + code, ask for help
2. **Simplify approach**: Maybe there's an easier way?
3. **Skip for now**: Mark as TODO, move to next task
4. **Research break**: 15 min maximum googling
5. **Ask community**: Stack Overflow, Reddit, Discord

### When Behind Schedule
1. **Scope review**: What can be cut from MVP?
2. **AI acceleration**: Generate more code, write less manually
3. **Template switching**: Move from Full App to MVP template
4. **Deadline adjustment**: Better to ship late than never
5. **Learning capture**: What caused the delay?

### When Losing Motivation
1. **Deploy something**: Even if incomplete, get it live
2. **Show progress**: Share screenshots, demos
3. **Review past wins**: Check completed projects
4. **Take a break**: Sometimes 24h rest helps
5. **Reminder of purpose**: Why are you building this?

## Daily Mantras
- ✅ **Done is better than perfect**
- 🚀 **Ship something every week**
- 🤖 **AI is my coding partner, not replacement**
- 📈 **Small progress daily beats heroic sprints**
- 🎯 **Focus on one thing at a time**

## Productivity Hacks
- **Pomodoro**: 25 min coding + 5 min break
- **Music playlists**: Different music for different tasks
- **Caffeine timing**: Peak focus when you need it most
- **Exercise breaks**: Walk/stretch every 2 hours
- **Hydration**: Keep water bottle at desk

## Time Tracking (Optional)
