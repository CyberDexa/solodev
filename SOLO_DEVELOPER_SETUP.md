## ⚡ Quick Start Paths

### Path 1: Weekend Project (2 days)
```markdown
Goal: Working prototype deployed and shared

Saturday (8 hours):
- Morning: Planning (1 hour) + Setup (1 hour)  
- Afternoon: Core development (6 hours)

Sunday (6 hours):
- Morning: Polish and testing (3 hours)
- Afternoon: Deploy and share (3 hours)

Use: MVP Template + Phase Shortcuts
Expected outcome: Basic working app with core feature
```

### Path 2: Two-Week Sprint (10 working days)
```markdown
Goal: Feature-complete MVP ready for users

Week 1: Foundation
- Days 1-2: Planning & Architecture
- Days 3-5: Core Development

Week 2: Launch  
- Days 6-8: Feature completion & integration
- Days 9-10: Testing, deployment, and launch

Use: MVP Template + Full Phases
Expected outcome: Production-ready application with user feedback
```

### Path 3: Professional Project (4-8 weeks)
```markdown
Goal: Comprehensive application ready for growth

Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Core Features
Weeks 3-4: Advanced Features & Integration
Weeks 5-6: Testing, Polish & Launch
Weeks 7-8: Optimization & Growth

Use: Full App Template + All Phases
Expected outcome: Scalable, maintainable application with documentation
```

## 🤖 AI Integration Strategy

### AI Contribution Targets by Phase:
- **Phase 1 (Planning)**: 50-60% - AI helps with research, architecture decisions
- **Phase 2 (Design/Dev)**: 70-80% - AI generates most code, you customize
- **Phase 3 (Development)**: 80%+ - AI handles implementation, you integrate
- **Phase 4 (Launch)**: 60-70% - AI assists with testing, documentation

### Essential AI Tools Setup:
1. **Code Editor**: Cursor IDE (preferred) or VS Code + Copilot
2. **Chat AI**: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, or Cursor's built-in AI
3. **Prompts**: Use templates from `03_AI_AUTOMATION/prompt_library.md`

## 📊 Success Metrics

- [ ] Application deployed and accessible via URL
- [ ] Core user journey works end-to-end
- [ ] No critical bugs in main features
- [ ] Mobile responsive (basic)
- [ ] Reasonable load times (<3 seconds)

### Business Success (Varies by Template):

## 🛠️ Core Workflow Principles

### 1. Ship First, Perfect Later
- Working software is better than perfect plans
- Deploy early and often
- Collect real user feedback before adding features

### 2. AI-First Development
- Use AI for code generation, then customize
- AI for research and decision-making support  
- Human oversight for architecture and business decisions

### 3. Timeboxed Execution
- Set clear deadlines and stick to them
- Better to ship 80% complete than 100% never
- Regular progress check-ins and scope adjustments

### 4. Quality Gates Without Bureaucracy
- Essential quality checks at each phase
- Focus on user impact over technical perfection
- Automate quality checks where possible
